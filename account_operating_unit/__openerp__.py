Accounting with Operating Units
===============================
This module introduces the following features:
- Adds the Operating Unit in the account move line.
- Defines if the operating units are self-balanced and Inter-operating unit
clearing account at company level.
- When users create a journal entry with lines in different operating units,
if operating units have been defined to be self-balanced,
at the time of posting the journal entry it automatically creates the
corresponding lines in the Inter-operating unit clearing account,
making each OU self-balanced.
- The account financial reports include the option to filter by OU.
- Adds the Operating Unit in the invoice
- Implements security rules in the invoice
